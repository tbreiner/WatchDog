# WatchDog
The WatchDog Pebble app for communicating with an Arduino sensor at home while you're on the go with your PebbleWatch.

This project was designed and implemented as a group term project with Ryan Smith and Brad Thompson during Spring 2015 under direction of Chris Murphy. A "User Guide" for explaining the functionality and uses of the product if it were to be actually marketed can be found [here](github.com/tbreiner/WatchDog/tree/master/Docs/WatchDogUserGuide.pdf). (Dramatized to relate this school assignment to the real world).

There were three parts to this project: interaction with the user via the Pebble Watch, communication with the Arduino sensors, and the relaying of messages as well as storing of data on a built-in server running on our local computer. The initial skeletons for the javascript and arduino files to facilitate communication between the server and the other aspects was provided to us by Dr. Murphy for us to adapt to our needs. The full technical documentation that was submitted as our project report and which can explain the decisions made during the design process can be found [here](github.com/tbreiner/WatchDog/tree/master/Docs/WatchDog Technical Documentation.pdf).
